## Documentation of RT1 Second Assignment
I created the documentation for the first semester assignment using Sphinx. Sphinx is a powerful documentation generation tool that allows for the creation of structured and well-formatted documentation for codebases. The documentation is written using reStructuredText (reST) markup language and can be transformed into various output formats such as HTML, PDF, and ePub.

To set up Sphinx for my project, I followed these steps:

1-Installed Sphinx by following the steps provided in the lecture or the official Sphinx website.
2-Initialized Sphinx by running sphinx-quickstart in the terminal from the root directory of the package I wanted to document. This command created a source directory containing the configuration file (conf.py) and the main documentation file (index.rst).
3-Wrote the documentation by editing the index.rst file in the source directory. Sphinx provides various directives and markup syntax for structuring the documentation.
4-Built the documentation by running make html in the terminal from the root directory of my project. This command generated the HTML output in the build directory.
5-Viewed the documentation by opening the generated HTML files in a web browser.
